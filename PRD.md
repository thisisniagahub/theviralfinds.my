    12-2 PM = 0.8  (Lunch Rush — lunch break scrolling)
    9 PM-12 AM = 0.75 (Impulse Hour — late night shopping)
    6-8 AM  = 0.5  (Morning Commute)
    Other   = 0.3  (Off-peak)

  Day_Weight:
    Friday  = 1.0  (Payday weekend)
    Saturday = 0.9 (Weekend shopping)
    Sunday  = 0.85 (Weekend preparation)
    Wednesday = 0.7 (Mid-week browsing)
    Other   = 0.6

  Platform_Weight:
    TikTok:   Peak 7-9 PM, strong 12-2 PM
    Instagram: Peak 7-9 PM, strong 6-8 AM
    Facebook: Peak 12-2 PM, strong 7-9 PM
    YouTube:  Peak 9 PM-12 AM
    Twitter/X: Peak 8-10 AM, 12-2 PM

**Product Scoring Algorithm:**

```typescript
interface ProductScoreInput {
  commissionRate: number      // 0-100% → weight 25%
  conversionRate: number      // 0-100% → weight 30%
  averageOrderValue: number   // RM      → weight 20%
  competitionLevel: number    // 0-100 (lower = better) → weight 10%
  salesVolume: number         // units/month → weight 10%
  trendDirection: number      // -1 to 1 → weight 5%
}

function calculateScore(input: ProductScoreInput): number {
  const commission = normalize(input.commissionRate, 0, 50) * 25
  const conversion = normalize(input.conversionRate, 0, 15) * 30
  const aov = normalize(input.averageOrderValue, 0, 500) * 20
  const competition = (1 - normalize(input.competitionLevel, 0, 100)) * 10
  const sales = normalize(input.salesVolume, 0, 10000) * 10
  const trend = ((input.trendDirection + 1) / 2) * 5

  return Math.round(commission + conversion + aov + competition + sales + trend)
}

// Score levels:
// 80-100: HOT → "Promote this NOW!"
// 60-79:  GOOD → "Strong potential"
// 40-59:  AVERAGE → "Consider carefully"
// 0-39:   SKIP → "Not worth the effort"
```

**Commission XTRA Data:**

Commission XTRA is a Shopee program that offers additional commission on top of the base rate during promotional periods:

```
Effective Commission = Base_Commission_Rate × (1 + XTRA_Percentage)

Example:
  Base rate: 8%
  XTRA: 40%
  Effective: 8% × 1.4 = 11.2%
  
  On RM100 product:
    Normal commission: RM8.00
    With XTRA: RM11.20 (+RM3.20)
```

**Earnings Calculator:**

```
Same-Shop Model (higher commission):
  Commission = Order_Amount × (Base_Rate + XTRA_Rate)
  If customer buys multiple items from same shop: commission applies to entire order

Different-Shop Model:
  Commission = Item_Price × Base_Rate (per item)
  Each item calculated independently

Projection:
  Daily_Earnings = (Daily_Clicks × Conversion_Rate) × Avg_Commission
  Monthly_Earnings = Daily_Earnings × 30
  Yearly_Earnings = Daily_Earnings × 365

Break-Even:
  Clicks_Needed = Target_Earnings / (Conversion_Rate × Avg_Commission)
```

```

### Frontend Architecture

**Routing:** Single-page application using Zustand `activePage` state (not Next.js file-based routing)

```
page.tsx → AppContent()
  ├── AppSidebar (desktop navigation)
  ├── MobileSheet (mobile slide-out menu)
  ├── AppHeader (top bar)
  ├── <Suspense> → PageComponent (lazy-loaded)
  ├── MobileNav (bottom navigation)
  └── FAB (floating Hermes AI button)
```

**State Management:**

| Store | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Zustand `app-store` | UI state: activePage, sidebarOpen, shopeeConnected, hermesConnected |
| TanStack Query | Server state: API data with caching and auto-refresh |
| Local component state | Form inputs, modals, filters |

**Page Loading:**
- All 18 page components are lazy-loaded via `React.lazy()`
- Shared `<PageLoader>` skeleton component during loading
- Framer Motion for page transition animations

### Backend Architecture

**API Design:** RESTful API routes using Next.js App Router

**Pattern per route:**
```typescript
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  try {
    // 1. Parse query parameters
    // 2. Check cache (if applicable)
    // 3. Fetch from real API / database
    // 4. Fallback to mock/demo data if needed
    // 5. Return JSON response with source indicator
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Message' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

**Caching Strategy:**

| Data Type | Cache TTL | Storage |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Shopee connection status | 5 minutes | In-memory |
| Trending products | 30 minutes | In-memory |
| Competitor analysis | 30 minutes | In-memory |
| Trending keywords | 30 minutes | In-memory |
| Dashboard/Analytics | No cache | Real-time |
| Earnings | No cache | Real-time |
| Content library | No cache | Database |

## 10. HERMES AI Agent

### Overview

HERMES is an AI agent integration that provides intelligent assistance for affiliate marketing operations. It is powered by z-ai-web-dev-sdk's LLM chat completion API and maintains persistent memory across sessions.

### Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Chat** | Natural language conversations about affiliate marketing | z-ai-web-dev-sdk LLM chat with conversation history |
| **Skills** | Custom AI skills with triggers and execution logic | Database-backed skill definitions with category/type system |
| **Tasks** | Scheduled automated tasks (cron-based) | HermesTask model with schedule, status, and result tracking |
| **Insights** | AI-generated business insights from data | Analysis of DB stats → AI interpretation → structured insights |
| **Memory** | Persistent conversation and preference memory | AgentMemory model with agent/session/content indexing |

### Chat Flow

```
User sends message
  → POST /api/hermes/chat { message, conversationId? }
  → If no conversationId: create HermesConversation
  → Save user message as HermesMessage (role: "user")
  → Load conversation history (last 20 messages)
  → Build system prompt with context:
      "You are HERMES, an AI assistant for Malaysian Shopee affiliates..."
  → Call z-ai-web-dev-sdk LLM chat completion
  → Save AI response as HermesMessage (role: "assistant")
  → Return response to client
```

### Skills System

Skills are reusable AI capabilities that can be triggered by natural language or scheduled tasks:

| Pre-built Skill | Trigger | Capability |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| Product Analyzer | "analyze product" | Score products for profitability |
| Content Writer | "write content" | Generate marketing content |
| Trend Monitor | "check trends" | Discover trending products |
| Competitor Spy | "spy competitor" | Analyze competitor strategies |
| Commission Finder | "find commission" | Locate Commission XTRA products |

### Task Automation

Tasks enable scheduled execution of skills:

```typescript
// Example task: Daily trend check
{
  name: "Daily Trend Check",
  schedule: "0 9 * * *",  // Every day at 9 AM
  skillId: "trend-monitor-skill-id",
  status: "scheduled"
}

// Execution flow:
// 1. Cron trigger fires
// 2. Task status → "running"
// 3. Execute associated skill
// 4. Save result to task.lastResult
// 5. Update task status → "completed" or "failed"
// 6. Increment task.runCount
```

### Insight Generation

```
GET /api/hermes/insights
  → Query database for current stats:
      - Total clicks, conversions, earnings
      - Recent performance trends
      - Top products and categories
  → Build analysis prompt with stats
  → Call z-ai-web-dev-sdk for insight generation
  → Parse and structure insights:
      { type, title, description, severity, data }
  → Save to HermesInsight table
  → Return insights
```

|----|------------|----------|
| POST-01 | Facebook Graph API integration (Page posting) | Must |

### 16.6 AI Superpowers (Fasa 3)

#### 16.6.1 AI Product Recommender

**Solution:** Based on user's audience profile (age, gender, interests from click data) and past conversion performance, recommend the best products to promote.

**Algorithm:**
```
Recommendation Score = Audience_Match (40%) + Commission_Potential (30%) + Trend_Signal (20%) + Competition_Gap (10%)

Where:
  Audience_Match = similarity(user_audience_profile, product_buyer_profile)
  Commission_Potential = commission_rate × avg_order_value × conversion_rate
  Trend_Signal = trending_direction × velocity
  Competition_Gap = 1 - normalized(number_of_competing_affiliates)
```

#### 16.6.2 Smart Commission XTRA Alert Bot

**Solution:** Monitor Commission XTRA availability and push alerts to users via WebSocket and email.

**Alert Types:**
| Alert | Trigger | Channel |
|-------|---------|---------|
| XTRA Activated | New Commission XTRA product in user's niche | WebSocket + Email |
| XTRA Expiring | Commission XTRA ending within 24 hours | WebSocket + Push |
| High-Value XTRA | Commission XTRA > 30% in user's category | WebSocket + Email + Push |
| Competitor XTRA | Top competitor promoting XTRA product | WebSocket |

#### 16.6.3 AI A/B Content Testing

**Solution:** Generate 3 content variants and predict performance using historical data.

```
For each generated content:
  1. Generate 3 variants (different hooks/CTAs/tone)
  2. Score each variant using AI (predicted CTR, engagement)
  3. Present to user with prediction scores
  4. After posting, track actual performance
  5. Feed results back to improve prediction model
```
